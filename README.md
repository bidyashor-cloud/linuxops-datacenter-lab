# **LinuxOps – System Administration & Troubleshooting Lab**

## **Overview**

I built this project to strengthen my hands-on experience in Linux system administration and troubleshooting—focusing on tasks commonly performed in data center and production environments. Throughout this lab, I worked on user and permission management, system services, performance bottlenecks, disk utilization issues, basic automation, and incident simulation. I also documented troubleshooting steps and created RCA-style reports for each issue.

## **What I Worked On**

* Created and managed Linux users, groups, and file permissions
* Set up a secure directory for operational scripts
* Developed a sample **systemd** service to practice service management and failure recovery
* Wrote a Bash-based health-check script to monitor CPU, memory, disk usage, services, and logs
* Automated recurring checks using **cron**
* Simulated real-world incidents such as high CPU load, service crashes, and disk-full scenarios
* Performed detailed troubleshooting and prepared RCA documentation for each incident

## **Skills Practiced**

* Linux command-line administration
* Bash scripting and automation
* Cron job scheduling
* Systemd service operations
* Log inspection and diagnostics
* Performance troubleshooting (CPU, memory, disk)

## **Notes**

This lab is designed as a safe environment for practicing real-world Linux troubleshooting techniques and improving operational readiness for cloud and data center roles.
