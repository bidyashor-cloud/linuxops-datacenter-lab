\# LinuxOps – System Administration \& Troubleshooting Lab



\## Overview

I created this project to practice Linux system administration and troubleshooting tasks that are commonly performed in data center operations. I worked on user and permission configuration, system services, performance issues, disk usage problems, and basic automation using Bash and cron. I also simulated common incidents and documented troubleshooting steps and RCA-style notes.



\## What I Did in This Lab

\- Created Linux users, groups, and configured file permissions.

\- Set up a secure folder for operational scripts.

\- Created a sample systemd service to test service management and failure scenarios.

\- Wrote a Bash health-check script to monitor CPU, memory, disk, services, and log errors.

\- Scheduled the health-check script using cron.

\- Simulated incidents such as high CPU usage, service crash, and disk full.

\- Performed troubleshooting and prepared RCA notes for each incident.



\## Skills Practiced

\- Linux CLI

\- Bash scripting

\- Cron scheduling

\- Systemd service management

\- Log analysis

\- CPU, memory, and disk troubleshooting
